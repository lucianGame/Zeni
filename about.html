        Hello! I’m Zenith! I was born in my parents Los Angeles apartment with a frat party cheering me on from next door, and it’s been a party ever since. 
I graduated from CalArts with a BFA in Scenic Design and now work as a freelance Scenic Artist, Designer, and pretty much every other Art Department role there is. I feel incredibly lucky to turn imagination into reality alongside many talented teams! I'm grateful for my diverse experience with projects and I’ve found my favorites to be ones that are unconventional and stylized.

My artistic goals are to work on things that have a distinct voice and aesthetic. I grew up in the worlds of Tim Burton, Dr. Suess, Jim Henderson, and many other whimsical artists which drew me to the fantastical. I chase projects that feel a little magical, a little weird, and full of the same sense of wonder that first made me fall in love with art.
